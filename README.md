Hello, this is Neelam Khan's attempt at the BPS Coding Challenge!

After learning TailwindCSS, VueJS, and NuxtJS, I am happy to say I have completed my first mini project using Tailwind and Vue and hope it meets your standards for a junior developer.

Admittedly, I did struggle with some features but did my best to at least attempt them, namely the touch drag/swipe feature. I somewhat acheived this goal in a number of different ways but was failed to intergrate it correctly with the rest of my code. Overall, although my structure needs works, I am happy with the outcome of this challenge.
