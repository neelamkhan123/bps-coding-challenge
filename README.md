Hello, this is Neelam Khan's attempt at the BPS Coding Challenge!

After learning TailwindCSS, VueJS, and NuxtJS, I am happy to say I have completed my first mini project using Tailwind and Vue and hope it meets your standards for a junior developer.

Admittedly, I did struggle with some features but did my best to at least attempt them, namely the touch drag/swipe feature. I somewhat acheived this goal in a number of different ways but failed to intergrate it correctly with the rest of my code and was thus unsuccessful in implementing it. Overall, although my structure definitley needs works, I am happy with the outcome of my first challenge.
